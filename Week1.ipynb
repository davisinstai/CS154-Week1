    "Every programmer at every skill level gets errors in their code. Making mistakes is how we all learn to program. Programming is a little like solving a puzzle where the goal is to get the desired outcome through a series of attempts. You won't solve the puzzle if you're afraid to test if the pieces match. An error message will not break your computer. Remember, you can always reload a notebook if it stops working properly or you misplace an important piece of code. Under the edit menu, there is an option to undo changes. (Alternatively, you can use **command z** on Mac and **control z** on Windows.) To learn any skill, you need to be willing to play and experiment. Programming is no different. And you really cannot break the computer here (especially since our computers are virtual machines in the cloud that we can remake if we want!)."
